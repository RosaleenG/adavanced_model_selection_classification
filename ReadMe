Two models one basic the other advanced - both linear regression ML algorithms

Basic
Does not use class functions unlike advanced


Adavnced 
Linear regression model used to generate predictions, using standard scaler and onehotencoder
Extract Categories from json string
Validate categories to keep only the most common ones
Adjusts the goal feature to USD
Builds features computed from timestamps
Transform countries into larger groups to avoid having too many dummies
Update parameters after re-tuning the model
Processor for categories with one-hot encoding
Processor for countries with one-hot encoding
First level of column specific transformations
Add a scaling stage
Return X_train and y_train
fit
preprocess_unseen_data
predict
return self.model.predict(X)
